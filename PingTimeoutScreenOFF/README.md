### PING TIMEOUT SCREEN OFF SCRIPT  

####  Function:

Basicly this script checks if a specific device is responding to ping, it sends only 1 ping.  
If ping responds it does nothing, you can change that (line 21).  
If ping target does not answer, the script turns your screen off by sending a signal to display turn off.  

I made this because a friend wanted to turn his pc off but not his home server wich was connected on a secondary monitor and was lazy enough to power off manually.  

#### Please change the variables inside script before running.
