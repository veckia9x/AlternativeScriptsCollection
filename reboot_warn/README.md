## Reboot Warn  

The history for this simple script is that I had an issue with an old server (DELL PE 1950 II) and it rebooted randomly from time to time.  
And to track this, being lazy as I was, I just wrote this.  

I used Ubuntu Server and rc.local (which is not a good way) to execute this script once the system booted.  
Please use cronjob with @reboot.
