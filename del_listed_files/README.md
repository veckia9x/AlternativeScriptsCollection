## Delete Listed Files  
#### Please check file inside, there are a few variables to define.  
  
Mainly this script delete files that are on a list, this list is in an online github file.  
This way I can deploy several servers and delete the same files on each one of them, only needing to update one file.  
  
###### You can also change the json variables to modify username, user picture, message, etc...
